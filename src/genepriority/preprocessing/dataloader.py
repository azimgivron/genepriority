DataLoader module
=================

This module contains the `DataLoader` class for preprocessing and preparing gene-disease 
association data for gene prioritization tasks. It includes functionality for handling 
sparse matrices, random splits, cross-validation folds, and filtering based on association
thresholds.

Features:
- Load and preprocess gene-disease association data from CSV files.
- Create sparse matrices for gene-disease associations.
- Sample negative associations to balance datasets.
- Generate random splits and cross-validation folds for model training and evaluation.
- Filter data based on a minimum number of associations per disease or gene.
- Log detailed statistics for debugging and tracking preprocessing steps.

    DataLoader Class

    A utility class to handle the preprocessing and preparation of gene-disease
    association data for gene prioritization tasks. It provides methods for
    sparse matrix creation, random sampling and data splitting for cross-validation.

    Attributes:
        nb_genes (int): Number of genes in the dataset.
        nb_diseases (int): Number of diseases in the dataset.
        path (str): Path to the CSV file containing gene-disease associations.
        seed (int): Random seed for reproducibility in sampling and splitting operations.
        zero_sampling_factor (int, optional): Factor determining the number of negative
            associations (zeros) to sample relative to positive associations (ones).
        num_folds (int): Number of folds for cross-validation in the OMIM2 dataset.
        omim (sp.csr_matrix): Sparse matrix combining positive and sampled negative
            associations for OMIM.
        cv_masks (List[dict]): Masks for cross-validation folds.
        logger (logging.Logger): Logger instance for tracking and debugging the
            preprocessing steps.
        validation_size (float, optional): Proportion of data used for validation in splits.
