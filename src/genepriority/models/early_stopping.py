EarlyStopping Module
======================

Provides tools for monitoring validation loss and early stopping for machine learning models.
The EarlyStopping class tracks recent losses and corresponding model weights. If no improvement
is observed within a specified patience interval, it signals for early termination of training.

class EarlyStopping:
    """
    A callable class to determine early stopping during model training based on loss improvement.

    This class tracks the losses and corresponding model parameters over a specified
    number of iterations (patience). If the losses do not show a favorable improvement
    over the tracked iterations, the early stopping condition is met.

    Attributes:
        patience (int): Number of epochs/iterations to wait for an improvement before stopping.
        best_loss (float): Best (minimum) loss observed so far.
        since_improved (int): Number of consecutive epochs/iterations since the last improvement.
        best_weights (Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray] | None): Copies of model parameters (h1, h2)
            at the best observed loss. None if no weights have been saved yet.

        Update the early stopping criteria with a new loss and model weights.

        On each call, the new loss and a copy of the provided weights
        are compared against the best observed metrics. If the loss improves, the
        best_loss, since_improved counter, and best_weights are updated. If no
        improvement is observed for more than 'patience' iterations, early stopping
