Flip Labels Module
====================

Provides functionality to simulate label noise by flipping positive labels to negative labels
in matrix-based datasets. The API is designed to be straightforward and intuitive, allowing
users to apply noise on training masks at configurable intervals.

Features:
- Probabilistic label flipping for noise simulation.
- Resampling based on a configurable flipping frequency.

class FlipLabels:
    """
    A callable class for simulating label noise by randomly flipping a fraction of positive (1)
    entries to negatives (0) in a training mask.

    This class is useful for experiments where adding noise to the training labels is desired.
    The flipping operation is performed every `flip_frequency` iterations. On the designated
    iterations, a copy of the provided label matrix is made and a computed number of its positive
    entries are randomly selected and set to 0.

    Attributes:
        fraction (float): Fraction of observed positive entries (ones) in the training mask that
            will be flipped to negatives (zeros) to simulate label noise. Must be between 0 and 1.
        ones_indices (np.ndarray): Array of indices (row, col) identifying the locations of
            positive entries observed in the training mask.
        n_ones (int): Total number of positive entries observed in the training mask.
        n_to_zero (int): The number of positive entries to flip to negatives, computed as
            int(fraction * n_ones).
        flip_frequency (int): Frequency (in iterations) at which to resample the observed positive
            entries for flipping.
        flip_iteration (int): Counter tracking the number of iterations where the flipping
            operation has been performed or checked. It is updated each time the object is called.
        tmp_labels (np.ndarray): Temporary label matrix holding simulated label noise (not actively
            used in the __call__ method).

                0 and 1.
