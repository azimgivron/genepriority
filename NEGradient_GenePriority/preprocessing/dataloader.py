    DataLoader Class

    A utility class to handle the preprocessing and preparation of gene-disease
    association data for gene prioritization tasks. It supports two types of
    datasets (OMIM1 and OMIM2) and provides methods for sparse matrix creation,
    random sampling, and data splitting for cross-validation.

    Attributes:
        nb_genes (int): Number of genes in the dataset.
        nb_diseases (int): Number of diseases in the dataset.
        path (str): Path to the CSV file containing gene-disease associations.
        seed (int): Random seed for reproducibility in sampling and splitting operations.
        num_splits (int): Number of random splits to create for the OMIM1 dataset.
        zero_sampling_factor (int): Factor determining the number of negative associations
            (zeros) to sample relative to positive associations (ones).
        num_folds (int): Number of folds for cross-validation in the OMIM2 dataset.
        omim1 (List[sp.csr_matrix]): List of sparse matrices representing splits for
            OMIM1.
        omim2 (sp.csr_matrix): Sparse matrix combining positive and sampled negative
            associations for OMIM2.
        omim1_splits_indices (List[dict]): Indices for random splits of OMIM1 for
            training and testing.
        omim2_folds_indices (List[dict]): Indices for cross-validation folds of OMIM2.

            preprocessing steps.
