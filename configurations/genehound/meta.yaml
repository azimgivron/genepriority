# GeneHound Configuration File
# -----------------------------
#
# This file is used by the GeneHound pipeline.
# It defines parameters for data processing and simulation.

# Parameters:
#   direct: (bool) Whether to use a Cholesky or conjugate gradient (CG) solver.
#   univariate: (bool) Whether to use univariate or multivariate sampling.
#   save_freq: (int) Frequency at which model state is saved (e.g., every N samples).
#   burnin_period: (int) Number of initial samples to discard as burn-in.
#                  This period allows the sampler to reach convergence
#                  before collecting samples for training.
#   num_samples: (int) Number of samples to collect after the burn-in period,
#                 during the active period. (default: 1000).
